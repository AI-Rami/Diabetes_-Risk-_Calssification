ðŸ§ª Final Exam Project â€“ Diabetes Health Indicators Classification

This machine learning project analyzes the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset to predict whether an individual is at risk of developing diabetes. It covers full-cycle model development from data cleaning to performance evaluation.
